AUTOMATED AGRICULTURE

A  Revolutionary module created from IoT to Agriculture sector

Agriculture is one of the most under developed sectors in our country,there have been many issues faced by the farmer to grow crops and distribute it to the people ,So this is an arduino based model that makes gardening and farming happen without human interference . The system consist of a weather station, security system , robotic arms, transportation system, automated watering, dehumidifying , temperature controlling , fertilizer sprinkling , ultrasonic stimulation ,  etc.
     the main objective of this would to create efficient farming environment for 
     the farmers.

The weather station unit contains totally 9 sensors ,which is integrated by IoT.
The function of these sensors is to collect the environment data and to feed it to a cloud base.
The sensor used here would collect data like temperature, humidity, rain and soil moisture.
All these collected data would be useful for the current or future development of the farming technique.

Digital Storage

The Data collected from the sensors would uploaded to thingspeak cloud 
      which would provide with analytic graphs.
      The collection of data from the field would be at a rate of data/2 sec
      So there would be accuracy in the data collected
      These collected information would help the farmer to make changes in
      their methodology
